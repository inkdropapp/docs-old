The editor supports standard Markdown syntax as well as 
[GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) with inline formatting.

## Live Preview

Inkdrop supports live preview of note. You can switch to Side-by-Side Preview with `Cmd+P` (on macOS) / `Ctrl+P` (on Windows/Linux) keybind to see the editor and preview side-by-side like this:

You can even hide the toolbar on the top of the editor from the preferences if you don't need it.

This is another way to organize your notes.
