## Get acquainted with Inkdrop interface

Inkdrop interface is broken up into 3 main sections.

![Layout](./basic-usage_screen.png)

- **Sidebar** is the leftmost section. It lists notebooks, statuses, and tags. 
  - Notebooks are like folders that store your notes. You can nest notebooks in one another as deeply as needed.
  - Statuses help you treat notes as tasks and, for example, display only active or completed ones. 
  - Tags are like labels that let you link notes with one another. For example, if they relate to a common topic.
  You can toggle the Sidebar by using <kbd>Command+/</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+/</kbd> on Windows and Linux.
- **Note list** is located amid. All your notes live here ordered by modification date by default. You can search for notes via the search box at the very top of the section.
- **Editor** is the rightmost section. This is where your magic happens ðŸª„ â€” your workspace. 

**More useful shortcuts:**

- <kbd>Command+E</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+E</kbd> â€” to switch between the editor and preview modes.
- <kbd>Command+P</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> â€” to display the editor and preview side-by-side.
- <kbd>Command+Shift+D</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+D</kbd> â€” to enter/leave the 'Distraction Free Mode' ðŸ§˜ Is when the sidebar and note list are hidden, and you can focus on the writing process.

To create a new note, you can either click the ![ui-icon](/images/icons/pencil-write.svg) icon on the right top of the note list or use the <kbd>Command+N</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> shortcut. The newly created note will appear in the **Note list** section.
