## Inkdrop has three parts

![Layout](/manual/02-basic-usage_screen.png)

* **Sidebar** (on the left): it lists notebooks and tags here. Notebooks are like folders you can create recursively. Tags are like labels which can link notes with related topic.
* **Note list** (in the middle): all your notes live here, ordered by modification date by default. You can search notes with keywords from a search bar on the top of it.
* **Editor** (on the right): this is where your magic happens; you're looking at it. 😄

## Creating new note and notebook

To create new note, you can either push a button on the right top of the note list or input keybind `Cmd+N` / `Ctrl+N`.
